The file that I was sending was very small (right around 1K),
 so I think that the system I'm on was thinking it was spam
 and erasing everything in it. When I upped the size of the file 
(anywhere over 4K) it would send the attachment and it had info. 
However, I am now running into a new problem in that some of my 
info in the attachment is getting deleted. There doesn't seem to
 be any rhyme or reason as to where it is getting cut off. 
Sometimes, only a few lines get cut off, but other times 
I'm losing around a quarter of my data. What could possibly be causing this? I might have figured out what is going on.
